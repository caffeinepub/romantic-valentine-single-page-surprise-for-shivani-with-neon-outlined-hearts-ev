  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-7 are clearly implemented in the shown diffs (prompt text/buttons in App.tsx and updated HTML title in index.html). The remaining requirements rely on components/assets/hooks whose implementations or existence are not evidenced in the provided diff summary (no added files; only App.tsx/index.html content shown), so they cannot be verified and appear missing from the diff evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement/keep a full-viewport animated \"live wallpaper\" background of many small neon hollow outlined hearts that float upward continuously from bottom to top using a pink-and-white neon heart color scheme.",
      "reason": "App.tsx renders a <NeonHeartsBackground /> component, but the diff does not include the implementation of that component or any CSS/canvas logic proving the full-viewport upward-floating hollow neon hearts behavior.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Make the hearts background interactive so pointer movement and touch input visibly affects nearby hearts (e.g., repulsion/drift and/or glow intensity changes), while maintaining the upward floating motion.",
      "reason": "No implementation details for interactive pointer/touch effects are present in the provided diffs; only a component import/usage is shown.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Make the \"i dont like you\" button evade interaction so it cannot be clicked and relocates within viewport without overlapping the \"yess\" button region.",
      "reason": "App.tsx wires hover/pointer/touch handlers to handleEvade, but the logic guaranteeing viewport bounds and avoiding overlap with the \"yess\" button depends on useEvasiveButton implementation, which is not included in the diff summary.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "When the user clicks \"yess\", transition to a success view that shows a meme image and displays the exact caption text: \"Hehehe Good gurl 😚💗\".",
      "reason": "App.tsx switches to a <SuccessMeme /> view on clicking \"yess\", but the diff does not show SuccessMeme contents to verify the meme image rendering and exact caption text.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx"

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Provide the required static meme image asset at `frontend/public/assets/generated/valentine-meme.dim_1200x800.png` and render it via a static `/assets/generated/...` path.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added asset file (\"Added: 0\") and no SuccessMeme implementation demonstrating it uses `src=\"/assets/generated/valentine-meme.dim_1200x800.png\"`.",
